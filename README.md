# ecommerce-marketing-analysis
This is why we say that #Data #Analytics is important to the growth of any firm. I worked on this #project recently and what got me most interested are the variables.

The #project is based on the data of an E-commerce company based in New York City that sells clothing online but they also have in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers come in to the store, have sessions/meetings with a personal stylist, then they can go home and order either on a mobile app or website for the clothes they want.

There were 5 major variables used in this #analysis:

1. Avg. Session Length: Average session of in-store style advice sessions.

2. Time on App: Average time spent on App in minutes

3. Time on Website: Average time spent on Website in minutes

4. Length of Membership: How many years the customer has been a member.

5. Yearly Amount Spent: Amount of money spent on the store yearly by each customer

The goal was to know which of the variables are most important to the amount of money spent by each customer yearly.

After carrying out some #descriptive analysis on the dataset, I used #machinelearning to evaluate the impact of each variable on how much each customer spends yearly.

SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:

- A minute change in the average session length (clothing advise) of the #customers will most likely increase the yearly amount spent of each customer by $25 and vise versa.

- one minute increase in the length of time spent on the website per year will most likely increase the yearly amount of money spent by a customer by $0.3 and vise versa

- All things being equal, A year increase in the length of time a #customer has been a member of this company will have approximately $61 increase in the yearly amount spent for this customer and vise versa

-All things being equal, One more minute spent on the App per year will most likely increase the yearly amount spent by each customer by $38

From my findings, I'd advise the #company focuses on the mobile App more than the website and this is understandable because of the comfort of using mobile apps than using web browsers. 

The company should also work on getting people to subscribe to their membership because the result is really going to be massive!! There are more findings to this.

I have attached the document containing the #codes and other analysis made to this post.
